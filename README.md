# hillmer_says_hellow
Doug Hillmers First public repository

This is my first attempt to set up git for myself privately.
Previously we had a corporate setup but  I am no longer with
"The Company" so now I have to do all of this administrative 
stuff myself, sigh.

BTW that previous intro blurp paragraph was added using the
web interface editor. Next step is to clone this repo on my
rPI and see that I can do things there.

This third paragraph was added using vi on the rPI.  Now it
will be commited to the project.  It should show up back on
my gitHub page.
